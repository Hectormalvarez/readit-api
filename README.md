# Readit API

## Overview

This specification defines the enterprise-grade application programming interface (API) for the "Readit" Book Reading Tracking Application. The API is designed to provide a robust and scalable platform for integrating with mobile applications, enabling users to seamlessly manage their reading experience.

## Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
* **Comprehensive Book Management:** CRUD operations for books, including reading lists, finished books, and wish lists.
* **Detailed Progress Tracking:** Granular tracking of reading progress, including page count, annotations, and timestamps.
* **Extensibility:** Flexible design allows for future enhancements and integrations to meet evolving business requirements.

## Architecture

* **Backend:** Django REST Framework with a focus on code efficiency and maintainability.
* **Testing:** Rigorous test suite using pytest to ensure API reliability and stability.

## Security Considerations

* **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
* **Authentication:** JWT tokens are used for session management, ensuring secure access to API resources.
* **Authorization:** Access control mechanisms enforce role-based permissions, restricting unauthorized access to data.

## Future Roadmap

* **Integration with Third-Party Services:** Support for external services such as book recommendations and social media platforms.
* **Analytics and Reporting:** Dashboard and reporting capabilities for tracking API usage and identifying areas for improvement.
